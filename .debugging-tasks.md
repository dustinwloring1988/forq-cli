## ‚úÖ **Detailed Actionable Task Checklist for Fixing the Agentic REPL Workflow**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Unify Tool Execution and Final AI Response Logic**

- [x] Remove non-blocking calls in the `onComplete` callback of `streamAI`; always await the final AI response.
- [x] Consolidate duplicate `processToolCalls` functions into a single async function that:
  - [x] Executes each tool sequentially (or in a controlled parallel manner if needed).
  - [x] Feeds the tool result back into the AI via `sendToolResultToAI` and awaits the response.
  - [x] Continues iterating until the AI's response indicates no further tool calls.
- [x] Refactor `sendToolResultToAI` calls to ensure they return promises that are properly awaited.

---

### üîÑ **Centralize the "Wait for AI to Finish" Loop**

- [x] Refactor the main REPL loop in `repl.ts` to encapsulate the following:
  - [x] A function (e.g., `handleUserInput`) that processes the user input by:
    - [x] Adding the user message to the conversation.
    - [x] Invoking `streamAI` and awaiting its complete output.
  - [x] An inner async function (e.g., `processAnyToolUsage`) that:
    - [x] Checks if the AI response includes tool calls.
    - [x] Executes and awaits all tool calls sequentially.
    - [x] Continues to send results back to the AI until a final response with no pending tool calls is received.
- [x] Ensure that the REPL prompt is not re-displayed until the entire chain (plan, tool execution, final answer) is fully completed.

---

### ‚è± **Ensure Proper Promise Handling**

- [x] Replace any usage of `.then()` with `async/await` in all tool-call chains within `repl.ts` and `ai.ts`.
- [x] Verify that every asynchronous operation (including tool execution and subsequent AI calls) is properly awaited so that no part of the chain returns control prematurely.

---

### üí° **Choose and Consistently Apply Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Approach**

- [x] Decide whether the AI response will be streamed to the user in real time or only the final response will be shown.
- [x] If streaming:
  - [x] Ensure that the partial chunks are displayed but the final prompt only appears after the full response and tool cycle are complete.
- [x] If non-streaming:
  - [x] Refactor the call to use `queryAI` instead of `streamAI` and adjust the control flow accordingly.
- [x] Test the chosen approach to ensure the user never sees a prompt until the AI is completely done.

---

### üß™ **Thorough Testing of the Final Agentic Workflow**

- [x] Create test scenarios where the AI issues multiple tool calls in sequence.
- [x] Verify that in each test scenario:
  - [x] The REPL does not display a new prompt until the complete task chain is finished.
  - [x] The final AI response (with any incorporated tool results) is presented clearly.
- [x] Validate that the system does not hang or prematurely return control in any scenario.
