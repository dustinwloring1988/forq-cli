---

### üöÄ **Project Initialization and Setup**

- [x] Create a GitHub repository named `forq-cli`.

- [x] Maintain command history navigation using arrow keys.
- [x] Add REPL prompt customizations (colors, context indicators).

---

### üß† **System Prompt and User Prompt Management**

- [x] Create and store the `systemPrompt` text in a dedicated config file (`config/systemPrompt.ts`).
- [x] Load and inject `systemPrompt` at initialization of AI context.
- [x] Accept user input as a structured `userPrompt` for sending to AI API.
- [x] Ensure prompts follow formatting standards (Markdown/structured JSON).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **AI Integration and Semantic Querying**

- [x] Install and configure the Anthropic SDK (or compatible alternative API client).
- [x] Set up `.env` file to securely store API keys and environment variables.
- [x] Implement function to query AI (`queryAI(messages: Message[])`) with streaming output.
- [x] Verify basic API connectivity by sending a simple test message and receiving response.

---

### üìÇ **Tool System: Core Implementation**

- [x] Define `Tool` interface with structured inputs, outputs, and execution logic.
- [x] Implement dynamic tool loading mechanism (e.g., scan `tools/` directory at startup).
- [x] Provide a method (`executeTool`) to invoke tools based on AI-generated tool calls.
- [x] Verify basic tool invocation through mock calls in REPL.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Individual Tools Implementation**

#### **File System Tools**

- [x] Implement `listDir` tool: List files/directories at given path.
- [x] Implement `readFile` tool: Return file content securely.
- [x] Implement `editFile` tool: Overwrite file content after diff verification.
- [x] Implement `deleteFile` tool: Delete specified file safely (with confirmation prompt).
- [x] Implement `createFile` tool: Create new files with content, checking for existing files.

#### **Search Tools**

- [x] Implement `fileSearch` tool: Fuzzy match filenames across directories.
- [x] Implement `ripgrepSearch` tool: Regex content search via `ripgrep`.

#### **Semantic Tools**

- [ ] Set up basic semantic embedding mechanism (stub function for embedding text).
- [ ] Implement `semanticSearch` tool: Return semantically relevant code snippets based on query.
- [ ] Implement `readSemanticSearchFiles` tool: Retrieve top semantic matches with full file content.

#### **Terminal Command Tool (Bash Integration)**

- [ ] Implement `bash` tool: Execute commands in a secure, persistent shell session.
- [ ] Ensure commands have strict permission verification (banned commands, safe execution environment).
- [ ] Capture and handle stdout/stderr, enforce timeout mechanisms (default 2 min).
- [ ] Persist environment variables and working directories between bash calls.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Permission System**

- [ ] Implement per-session permission store (in-memory).
- [ ] Prompt user clearly for tool permissions on first use (e.g., file access, shell command execution).
- [ ] Persist granted permissions in a session configuration (`config/session-permissions.json`).
- [ ] Enforce strict checking of permissions before any sensitive tool action.

---

### üìö **Context Management**

- [ ] Implement automatic loading of project-specific instructions from `FORQ.md`.
- [ ] Collect git context (current branch, modified files, recent commits) using bash tool.
- [ ] Provide summarized directory structure to AI on session start.
- [ ] Compact conversation history periodically (`/compact` command implementation).

---

### üìë **Configuration Management**

- [ ] Implement global config storage (`~/.forqrc.json`) to persist user preferences and API keys.
- [ ] Implement project-specific config (`.forqrc.json`) for allowed tools, commands, and local overrides.
- [ ] Provide CLI command (`forq config`) to view and edit configurations.

---

### üìä **Analytics & Error Handling**

- [ ] Implement basic analytics logging (session duration, commands used).
- [ ] Integrate Sentry or similar service for error reporting.
- [ ] Implement local error logging (`logs/error.log`) capturing stack traces.

---

### üîç **Logging & Auditability**

- [ ] Ensure each AI action (tool execution, API call) is logged in structured logs (`logs/actions.log`).
- [ ] Implement `forq log` CLI command to review session actions and AI decisions.
- [ ] Provide detailed diffs in logs for file modifications to track all file changes transparently.

---

### ‚úÖ **Testing & Quality Assurance**

- [ ] Configure Jest for testing (`tests/` directory).
- [ ] Write initial tests for core CLI functionality and prompt handling.
- [ ] Write unit tests for all tools individually, including edge cases and error handling.
- [ ] Establish GitHub Actions CI pipeline for running tests and linting checks on each PR.

---

### üìñ **Documentation & User Onboarding**

- [ ] Create initial README covering installation, configuration, and basic usage.
- [ ] Add detailed documentation (`docs/`) for each CLI command, prompt conventions, and available tools.
- [ ] Provide example workflows (e.g., bugfixes, feature implementations) in the documentation.
- [ ] Implement `forq help <command>` providing detailed contextual help.

---

### üìå **Release & Packaging**

- [ ] Set up semantic-release for automatic versioning and changelog generation.
- [ ] Prepare initial release package (`npm publish` settings and build scripts).
- [ ] Test release build in clean environment to verify installation and runtime behavior.

---

### üéØ **Example Use-Cases & Demonstrations**

- [ ] Demonstrate ability to plan and implement a simple feature (e.g., adding a function to a codebase).
- [ ] Demonstrate identifying and fixing a simple bug (e.g., typo, missing import).
- [ ] Verify AI autonomously performs file operations accurately (create/edit/delete).

---

### üîó **Roadmap & Iterations**

- [ ] Organize above tasks into structured GitHub Issues and Milestones.
- [ ] Prioritize issues clearly for incremental implementation (MVP features first).
- [ ] Schedule regular streams to demonstrate incremental progress.

---

### üö© **Final MVP Validation & Demo**

- [ ] Execute a full end-to-end demonstration: run `forq repl` in real codebase folder.
- [ ] Validate AI can analyze repository structure, recommend, and implement code modifications.
- [ ] Validate security prompts and permission system thoroughly.

---

### ‚úÖ **Definition of Done (for each task):**

- Implementation completed with clear and clean code.
- Unit tests provided, covering key scenarios.
- Documentation updated with accurate, clear explanations.
- Changes pass CI pipeline (linting, testing).
- Feature is demonstrable via REPL interface clearly and intuitively.

**All tasks in this detailed checklist represent single, actionable, one-story-point increments, and completion will result in a fully functional MVP of a terminal-based AI Coding Agent (Forq).**
