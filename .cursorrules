- After all changes are made, ALWAYS build the project with `npm run build`. Ignore warnings, fix errors.
- Always add a one-sentence summary of changes to `.cursor-updates` file in markdown format at the end of every agent interaction.
- If you forget, the user can type the command "finish" and you will run the build and update `.cursor-updates`.
- Finally, update git with `git add . && git commit -m "..."`. Don't push.
